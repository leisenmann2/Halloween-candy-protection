Using facerecognition to recognize myself and open a box in which I have stored my Halloween candy. The code is run on a Raspberry Pi with a camera and GPIO extension board for the electronics (lights and servo).
Main program is Halloween_candy_protection.py calling the others.
The Hardware and some codesnippets are from the Freenove RFID starter Kit.
The Facerecognition is done with opencv.
